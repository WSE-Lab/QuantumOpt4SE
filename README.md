This is the artifact of our submission, titled "Quantum Optimization for Software Engineering: A Survey," which is a systematic literature review of applying quantum and quantum-inspired optimization techniques to solve software engineering problems relevant to optimization.

During the peer review, we have our raw data available:

+ `initial_searching.csv`: All the raw data for initial keyword searching is included in this file. We presented the details of the 2083 primary papers after removing duplicates across databases.
+ `final_selection.csv`:  The file saves the results for 77 primary papers in the final list. All the included papers derive from keyword searching or snowballing. The presented data encompass all the results displayed in our manuscript in respond to the proposed research questions.
